## What does it do
Users can upload their image files to this service and use the generated unique url to access the raw image file later on:
 - `<websiteurl>/api/image/<generated image name>.<image format>`
 - `http://ec2-3-8-184-85.eu-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com:2999/api/image/8799c5e9-9fb8-4588-9a70-be0dcdd45b35.jpg`
 - generated link can be used to embed images
 - <img src="http://ec2-3-8-184-85.eu-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com:2999/api/image/8799c5e9-9fb8-4588-9a70-be0dcdd45b35.jpg" height=64px alt="embedded image. if you are seeing this that means either my test server is down or you are viewing an old version of the project">
 - Image's exif data(jpg exif) is removed on client side before uploading process starts
 - Uploaded images DO NOT gets deleted after 24 hours. i didn't implement it and forgor to change the frontend ðŸ’€

 - cd into the folder
 - `npm i`
 - create `.env` file in the root and fill the values:
   -  ```env
      ENABLE_HTTPS=       //true - false
      HTTP_PORT=          //if https isn't enabled
      HTTPS_PORT=         //if https is enabled

      DB_NAME =           //database name
      COLLECTION_NAME =   //collection name
      MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE =   //max image upload size in kb
      UPLOAD_SPEED =      //max image upload speed kbps
      PAGE_RATE_LIMIT =   //requests per ip adress per 10 seconds
      API_RATE_LIMIT =    //requests per ip adress per 10 seconds
      ```
   - default values are in the config.js
 - run with `npm start`
 - (optional) install pm2 to run it in background
   - `npm i pm2 -g`
   - add and start the server with `pm2 start server.js --name <a custom name>`
   - run `pm2 examples` for a general understanding of pm2
 - https option expects `private-key.key` and `certificate.crt` files in `ssl` folder

## About Versions
 - `main` : has the latest stable version
 - `stable-v*` : stable/completed versions
 - `dev-v*` : work-in-progress versions
 - `dev` : playground

## Known Bugs
 - Rotated images at file picking especially in apple devices. possibly caused by deletion of exif data.

### ToDo
 - [ ] Find a reason to use a lightweight local database
    - but i really liked the idea of not worrying about data losses when updating, restarting or straight up deleting the local repo ðŸ¥¹
 - [ ] convert to Typescript and take advantage of its abilities instead of writing plain js in .ts file like the last time ðŸ’€
 - [ ] remove exif data in server too
