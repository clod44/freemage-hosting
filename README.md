<hr>

## What does it do
Users can upload their image files to this service and use the generated unique url to access the raw image file later on:
 - `<websiteurl>/api/image/<generated image name>.<image format>`
 - `http://ec2-3-8-184-85.eu-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com:3000/api/image/8799c5e9-9fb8-4588-9a70-be0dcdd45b35.jpg`
 - generated link can be used to embed images
 - <img src="http://ec2-3-8-184-85.eu-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com:3000/api/image/8799c5e9-9fb8-4588-9a70-be0dcdd45b35.jpg" height=64px alt="embedded image. if you are seeing this that means either my test server is down or you are viewing an old version of the project">
 - Image's exif data(jpg exif) is removed on client side before uploading process starts
 - Uploaded images DO NOT gets deleted after 24 hours. i didn't implement it and forgor to change the frontend ðŸ’€

## About Versions
 - `main` branch will hold the latest stable version with patches.
 - `stable-v*` branches are stable archives.
 - `dev` branch holds the latest work-in-progress version.

## Known Bugs
 - Rotated images at file picking especially in apple devices. possibly caused by deletion of exif data.

### ToDo
 - [ ] Find a reason to use a lightweight local database
    - but i really liked the idea of not worrying about data losses when updating, restarting or straight up deleting the local repo ðŸ¥¹
 - [ ] convert to Typescript and take advantage of its abilities instead of writing plain js in .ts file like the last time ðŸ’€
 - [X] Use validators like ~~ZOD~~ `yup` for conveinence
 - [X] ~~Image Upload rate per session~~ API access rate per ip
 - [X] ~~Image access rate per session~~ Page access rate per ip
 - [X] Max image upload size
 - [ ] remove exif data in server too
 - [X] Use a modern requesting library like `axios`
